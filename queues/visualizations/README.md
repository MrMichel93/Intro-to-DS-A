# Visualizations

This folder contains visual aids, ASCII diagrams, and step-by-step illustrations to help you understand the concepts.

## Purpose

Visual learning is powerful! This folder will include:
- **ASCII diagrams** - Text-based visualizations you can view anywhere
- **Step-by-step walkthroughs** - See operations in action
- **Comparison charts** - Understand trade-offs
- **Real-world analogies** - Connect concepts to everyday experiences

## Coming Soon

Detailed visualizations for this module are being added progressively.

In the meantime, check out:
- The main README for this module (one level up)
- [Visualgo](https://visualgo.net/) - Interactive animations
- [Python Tutor](http://pythontutor.com/) - Step through code visually
