# Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms

Welcome! 👋 This repository is designed as a gentle introduction to data structures and algorithms for students ages 16-20. Whether you're just starting your computer science journey or looking to strengthen your foundations, you're in the right place!

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

This course covers essential data structures and algorithms that power today's applications and software. Each topic is broken down into digestible lessons with hands-on practice problems to solidify your understanding.

## 📚 Course Contents

### Data Structures
1. **[Arrays](./arrays/)** - The fundamental building block of data storage
2. **[Linked Lists](./linked-lists/)** - Dynamic data structures with connected nodes
3. **[Stacks](./stacks/)** - Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structures
4. **[Queues](./queues/)** - First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structures
5. **[Hash Tables](./hash-tables/)** - Fast key-value pair storage
6. **[Trees](./trees/)** - Hierarchical data structures
7. **[Binary Search Trees](./binary-search-trees/)** - Ordered tree structures
8. **[Graphs](./graphs/)** - Networks of connected nodes

### Algorithms
9. **[Sorting Algorithms](./sorting-algorithms/)** - Organizing data efficiently
10. **[Searching Algorithms](./searching-algorithms/)** - Finding data quickly

## 🚀 How to Use This Repository

Each folder contains:
- **README.md** - A comprehensive lesson on the topic with clear explanations and examples
- **6 Practice Problems** - Ranging from beginner to intermediate difficulty

We recommend going through the topics in order, as later concepts often build on earlier ones.

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Read the lesson first** - Understand the concepts before jumping into problems
2. **Try problems yourself** - Struggle is part of learning!
3. **Start with easier problems** - Build confidence before tackling harder ones
4. **Don't just copy solutions** - Make sure you understand WHY code works
5. **Practice regularly** - Consistency beats cramming
