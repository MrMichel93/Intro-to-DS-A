# Solutions

This folder is reserved for reference solutions to practice problems.

## Purpose

- Provide guidance when students are stuck
- Show best practices and optimal approaches
- Demonstrate different solution strategies

## Using Solutions Responsibly

**Try solving problems yourself first!** 

The learning happens in the struggle. Only look at solutions:
- After you've attempted the problem
- When you're truly stuck after 20-30 minutes
- To compare your working solution with alternatives
- To understand a concept you're missing

## Future Content

Solutions will be added progressively to help students learn effectively.
