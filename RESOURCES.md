## 💡 Tips for Using External Resources

### Don't Get Overwhelmed
- **Choose 2-3 resources** max per category
- **Quality over quantity:** Deep learning beats shallow breadth
- **Stick with what works:** Everyone learns differently

### Effective Use Strategy
1. **Primary:** Use this repository as your main curriculum
2. **Supplement:** Pick one visualization tool (VisuAlgo)
3. **Practice:** Choose one platform (HackerRank or LeetCode)
4. **Support:** Join one community (Reddit or Discord)
5. **Reference:** Keep one book or blog series handy

### When to Use What
- **Starting a topic:** Read this repo's README first
- **Stuck on concept:** Watch a YouTube video
- **Implementing:** Use Python Tutor to debug
- **Practicing:** Solve problems on LeetCode/HackerRank
- **Reviewing:** Use cheat sheets and quick references

### Avoiding Tutorial Hell
- ⚠️ **Warning signs:**
  - Watching videos without coding
  - Reading about algorithms but not implementing
  - Collecting resources instead of using them
  
- ✅ **Healthy approach:**
  - Watch → Code → Practice → Repeat
  - Solve problems, not just read about them
  - Build projects using what you learn
