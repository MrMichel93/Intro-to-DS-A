2. ✅ Review the module README thoroughly
3. ✅ Understand time and space complexity for all operations
4. ✅ Practice explaining concepts without looking at notes

#### Taking the Quiz:
1. ⏰ Set a timer for 45 minutes
2. 📝 Answer all questions to the best of your ability
3. 💭 Show your work for code analysis questions
4. 🤔 Think through short answer questions carefully

#### After the Quiz:
1. ✓ Check your answers against the answer key
2. 📖 Review concepts you missed
3. 🎯 Identify patterns in your mistakes
4. 🔄 Re-study weak areas before moving to the next module

#### For the Projects:
1. **Midterm Challenge**
   - Start after mastering Modules 0-5
   - Allocate 3-4 uninterrupted hours
   - Test your code thoroughly
   - Document your design decisions

2. **Final Project**
   - Begin planning after Module 8
   - Start implementation after Module 10
   - Follow the suggested 3-week timeline
   - Don't wait until the last minute!

### For Instructors

#### Using Checkpoints:
- Administer at the end of each module
- Can be used as in-class quizzes or take-home assessments
- Answer keys include grading rubrics for short answers
- Consider allowing students to use notes for short answer questions

#### Grading Guidelines:
- **Multiple Choice:** All or nothing per question
- **Code Analysis:** Partial credit possible if reasoning is sound
- **Short Answer:** Use rubrics provided in answer keys
- **Projects:** Use detailed rubrics in project specifications

#### Customization:

## 🎓 Assessment Philosophy

### Checkpoints Focus on Understanding
- Test conceptual knowledge, not memorization
- Emphasize time/space complexity analysis
- Require practical application of concepts
- Include code reading and analysis skills

### Projects Focus on Integration
- Apply multiple data structures together
- Make design decisions and justify them
- Experience real-world development challenges
- Practice documentation and testing

### Progressive Difficulty
- Early checkpoints focus on basics
- Later checkpoints assume cumulative knowledge
- Midterm integrates first half of course
- Final project integrates entire course

5. Document your design decisions as you go

### Completing the Final Project
1. Follow the suggested 3-week timeline
2. Implement features incrementally
3. Write tests alongside your code
4. Keep complexity requirements in mind
5. Refactor for clarity before submission

## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: Can I use external libraries?**  
A: For checkpoints, no. For projects, only Python standard library unless otherwise specified.

**Q: What if I don't finish a checkpoint in 45 minutes?**  
A: Note where you stopped, then review and study those areas. Checkpoints test your current understanding.

**Q: Can I reuse code from the practice problems?**  
A: Yes, but understand it thoroughly. You may need to modify it significantly.

**Q: How much time should I spend on the final project?**  
A: Plan for 8-12 hours total, spread over 2-3 weeks. Don't underestimate documentation and testing time.

**Q: What if I get stuck on a project?**  
A: Review relevant modules, check the hints section, draw diagrams, or ask for help during office hours.

**Q: Are the answer keys available to students?**  
A: Instructor decides. We recommend students check answers only after attempting the quiz.
